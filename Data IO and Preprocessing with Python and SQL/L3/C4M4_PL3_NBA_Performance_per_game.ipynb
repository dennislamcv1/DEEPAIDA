    "- **game_info**: contains information about each game between two teams, including things like the scores and the outcome.\n",
    "- **team_stats**: contains detailed statistics for each team in each game, such as points scored, rebounds, assists, and more.\n",
    "- **player_stats**: contains individual game stats for each player, including points, assists, rebounds, and other performance details.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The database is extensive, so queries might take a bit longer to complete.**\n",
